The issue lies in how foreach handles references.  In `bar`, we're using the original array's value and modifying a copy, resulting in no change to the original array. The solution is to either pass by reference as in `foo` (if modification is intended) or to make a copy of the array and use a standard foreach loop, ensuring that the original array is not modified unintentionally.
